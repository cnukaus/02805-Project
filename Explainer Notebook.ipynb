    "## 1.1 How and why we want to analyze the cryptocurrency developer community\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptocurrencies are maybe the most interesting economic phenomenon in recent years. Being able to basically generate money by running computer algorithms and doing very little work after an initial setup is a very tempting outlook for everybody. And even though the possible uses of bitcoin and co. to actually buy stuff from the real world are still limited, more and more people have jumped on the train of mining and trading with cryptocurrencies, resulting in huge value increases. In 2017 alone, the worth of bitcoin, the oldest, most common and most valuable cryptocurrency, has increased more than tenfold, [eclipsing the 10,000$ mark on November 28th](http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-clears-10000-2017-11-1009817597). This has lead to some interesting developments in recent time, such as prices for some computer hardware, especially powerful graphics cards, [almost doubling in the last year](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/cryptocurrency-mining-graphics-card-prices/).\n",
    "\n",
    "But just as more and more people have begun to join the virtual gold rush and try their luck at mining bitcoins with their home equipment, other groups of programming enthusiasts and cryptology specialists have started to create alternatives to the almighty bitcoin, resulting in hundreds of more or less valuable virtual forms of money being available and ready to be mined. In order to do so, one has to get a piece of source code from the internet, which is most of the time stored on github.\n",
    "\n",
    "Github itself, again, is not only a way to share and collaborate on programmin projects, but also has functions that make it a social platform, such as the ability to follow another user or to \"like\" a certain project or code reporitory. This second act is called \"stargazing\" in github terms. And that's where data science and social graphs come into play. We want to find out, how the stargazer community of different cryptocurrencies is shaped. In order to do so, we need to get the necessary information about the code repositories via the github api and then analyze it with tools of network science. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to take a look at the Wikipedia entries of some cryptocurrencies and try to find differences in word choice, etc. Because most of the digital currencies are very new or small, the number of Wikipedia entries is very limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *TL;DR:* **We want to analyze the community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts on github and the corresponding Wikipedia pages. We want to do this, because it is a booming, highly discussed industry that could change the face of the financial world**"
